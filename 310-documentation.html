    Introduction
  </h1>

  <p>These pages contain documentation about each of the custom
    controls which are provided for use with Teamstudio Unplugged</p>

  <p>The aim of the Controls is that you will be able to quickly build
    a mobile application to deploy onto Teamstudio Unplugged, which runs
    on
    iOS and Android devices. We assume that you have used XPages before,
    but
    the actual use of the Controls is not difficult, so you shouldn't
    need
    to have massive experience of mobile or web development to be able
    to
    create an application.</p>

  <h2>What's new in 3.1?</h2>
  <ul>
<li>UnpFormEditor controls now fully supports display and saving of data to a different database</li>
<li>Radio buttons now display correctly</li>
<li>A new toggle switch control can be used (for an example see the Sampler application)</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the navigator menu partially showed in portrait mode</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in the Sampler application where back button navigation worked incorrectly in Android</li>
<li>Fixed bug where Font Awesome icons did not display correctly in mobile web browser</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where pages did not display correctly after syncing</li>

<li>Improved demo of text editing in Sampler application</li>
<li>Fixed html data in Sampler application</li>
<li>Fixed bug where Dialog box was hidden under the navigator in landscape mode</li>
</ul>

  <p>In version 3 of the Controls we have significantly changed how things work, we've got new CSS, new JavaScript, more efficient native scrolling support and had a general overhaul of the Controls. So if you're upgrading an application we highly recommend that you replace all of the Controls, Stylesheets, Files etc. It might mean a little work to re-compile your XPages but will make life easier in the long run.</p>

  <p>We have also released a new Restyler tool which will allow you to create your own custom themes by changing colours, fonts and other CSS settings without having to make any code changes. For more details, please visit the <a href="http://restyler.teamstudio.com/">Restyler website</a>.

  <p>
    These Controls will work for "normal"
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/310/MobileWebDevelopment.html">Mobile
      Web Development</a>
    as well, so they can be accessed via the web browsers
    on your iPhone,
    iPad, or Android device.
  </p>

  <hr />
  <p>Detailed usage instructions for each control are available from the menu on each page.</p>

    <a
      href="{{ site.baseurl}}/310/UpgradingYourApplication.html">Upgrading
      your application</a>
    from a previous version of the Controls Library can be
    made easier by following some of our guidelines.
  </p>

  <hr />
  <p>
    We also provide some
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl}}/310/GenericClasses.html">generic
      classes which you can use in static HTML</a>
    .
  </p>

  <hr />
  <p>You will be building two types of XPage, firstly the "Main"
    page
    which will handle the application layout. All of the other pages are
    going to be requested via Ajax so we only need to include the
    content
    section for those.</p>

  <h1>
    <a name="building-the-unpmain-xpage" class="anchor"
      href="#building-the-unpmain-xpage">
      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
    </a>
    Building the UnpMain XPage
  </h1>

  <p>The main XPage is going to control the display of the page
    including the header, views list and footer. The XML below show an
    example of the main page you'll want to create:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/whitemx/7527732.js"></script>

  <p>As well as including Unpheader, UnpNavigator, UnpScrollableArea,
    UnpFlatView, and UnpFooter Controls you will always want to include
    the
    unplugged.css file.</p>

  <p>You'll notice the &lt;div&gt; called "content" which is used
    as a
    placeholder into which we can load the sub XPages using Ajax.</p>

  <h1>
    <a name="building-a-sub-xpage" class="anchor" href="#building-a-sub-xpage">
      <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
    </a>
    Building
    a sub XPage
  </h1>

  <p>Continuing the example above, when the user clicks the
    By Date
    link we want to load a new Sub XPage and insert the contents of it into
    the "content" container. This sub page is simply going to use the
    UnpScrollableArea and UnpFlatView Controls and doesn't need the
    header
    or footer as they have already been loaded on the UnpMain XPage.</p>

  <p>This is the XML required for the UnpDate XPage:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/whitemx/7527744.js"></script>
